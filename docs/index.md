# Motion Matching for Unity

## Community Maintained Fork

Welcome to the **Motion Matching for Unity (MxM)** documentation - a powerful animation system that brings cutting-edge motion matching technology to Unity.

!!! info "Fork Status"
    This is a **community-maintained fork** with Unity 2022+ support. The original asset was made free and open-source by its creator, and this fork continues development and maintenance for modern Unity versions.

## What is Motion Matching?

Motion Matching is a revolutionary animation technique that creates fluid, responsive character movement by intelligently selecting the best animation frame from a large motion database in real-time.

Unlike traditional Finite State Machines (FSM) or blend trees, Motion Matching:

- **Eliminates manual transition setup** - No more complex animator controllers
- **Provides natural responsiveness** - Characters react instantly to player input
- **Scales with content** - More animations = better results automatically
- **Handles complex locomotion** - Smooth transitions between any movement states

### Key Features

- **Unity Integration** - Seamless workflow with Unity's animation system
- **Trajectory Prediction** - Intelligent path planning for responsive movement
- **Tag System** - Event-driven animation control
- **Performance Optimized** - Efficient runtime with configurable quality settings
- **Modular Architecture** - Easy integration with existing game systems

## Use Cases

Motion Matching excels in scenarios requiring:

- **Third-person action games** with responsive combat
- **Open-world exploration** with varied terrain navigation
- **Sports simulations** requiring realistic human movement
- **Any project** where animation quality and responsiveness are critical
