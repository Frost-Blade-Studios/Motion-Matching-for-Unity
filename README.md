## About This Fork

This is a **community-maintained fork** of Motion Matching for Unity (MxM) with Unity 2022+ support.

### Original Asset Status

- ✅ Unity 2022.3 LTS compatibility
- ✅ Unity 6 tested

## What is Motion Matching?

Motion Matching is a revolutionary animation technique that creates fluid, responsive character movement by intelligently selecting the best animation frame from a large motion database in real-time.

Unlike traditional Finite State Machines, Motion Matching:

- **Eliminates manual transition setup** - No complex animator controllers
- **Provides natural responsiveness** - Instant reaction to player input
- **Scales with content** - More animations = better results automatically
- **Handles complex locomotion** - Smooth transitions between any movement states
